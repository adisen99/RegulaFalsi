# RegulaFalsi
MATLAB and Python code to determine the roots of  a function using the Regula-Falsi method or 'Method of false assumptions'

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


### Included files
There are in total 2 files in the repository one titled **MATLAB** and one titled **Python**. So you can use either syntax and program/language to numerically determine the roots of an equation/function using the Regula Falsi Method or algorithm.

To access the files you can either Download the zip file or use the following command from your terminal


``
git clone https://github.com/adisen99/RegulaFalsi.git
``

then


``
cd RegulaFalsi
``

**For the python file -**


``
cd Python
``

and 


``
python3 regula_falsi.py
``

**But, For the MATLAB files**


``
cd MATLAB
``

And then open the respective files in MATLAB. There are two MATLAB files provided `regfal.m` and `regula_falsi.m` and the two files are separate. They are different pieces of code essentially following the same algorithm. You are free to use either.


## Happy Coding
